      "value": "<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that is also in dim light or darkness, and can make an unarmed strike as part of the same action.</p><p>Furthermore, after teleporting in this way, once per turn, you can deal extra damage to one creature you hit with the unarmed strike as part of this bonus action or an attack made by the Attack action if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use an unarmed strike or a monk weapon (as listed under Martial Arts).</p><p>You do not need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy is not incapacitated, and you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll or if you are concentrating on a spell you cast using your Shadow Arts.</p><p>The size of these sneak dice equals your Martial Arts die on the Monk table. At 6th level you deal 3d8 bonus damage. The bonus damage becomes 4d10 at 11th level of monk and 5d12 at 17th level of monk.</p>",
