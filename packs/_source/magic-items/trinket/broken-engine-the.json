Known as the dark engine, it was manipulated and twisted to convert the latent energies of Deeproot to necrotic to fuel the hordes of undead. Upon observation, the center of the mass of this object noticeably glows. It appears to be made up of unidentifiable dark, tangled strands that are surrounded by an irregular lattice-like membrane of glass-like material. Its broken shape suggests heavily that its original shape was spherical.</p><p>While attuned to this powerful relic you have a number of charges equal to your <strong>proficiency bonus </strong>and gain the <em>Transmute Spells Metamagic. </em>This allows you to spend 1 charge when you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, and change it to another type from the same list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder.</p><p>Additionally, you gain access to one other <strong>Metamagic.</strong> The Metamagic that is available to you is determined each dawn by rolling on the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rollable-tables.RollTable.7E5A815FbZ9dK4ea]{Broken Engine - Metamagic} roll table.</p><p><br /><strong>Still Broken: </strong>Whenever the attuned expends a charge or charges they most roll a d6. See the table below for possible mishaps or unexpected results. Only with time and magical care can this relic perhaps return to its former magical wonderment. See the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rollable-tables.RollTable.CHdCp0ded4yVULRs]{Broken Engine - Still Broken} roll table.</p><p><strong>Spell Focus: </strong>A creature that has access to spellcasting can use this item as a spellcasting focus, as described in the <strong>Spellcasting</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Recharge: </strong>The broken engine regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p><section id=\"secret-gNUHyhE53pPe56fb\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>When you receive and attune to this item, you will want to add the Transmute metamagic, and whatever other metamagic you have for the day. You will also have to manually update the daily metamagic as well.</p></section>",
