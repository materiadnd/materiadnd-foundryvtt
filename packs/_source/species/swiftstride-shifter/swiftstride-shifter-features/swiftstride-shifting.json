      "value": "<p>As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Temporary hit points equal to 2 x your proficiency bonus.</li><li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This reactive movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</li></ul><p>You can shift a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Starting at 5th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while shifted, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Your transformation immediately ends as a result. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
