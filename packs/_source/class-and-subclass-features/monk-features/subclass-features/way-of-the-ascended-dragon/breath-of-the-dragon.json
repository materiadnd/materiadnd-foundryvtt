      "value": "<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a 15 foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to a given number of rolls of your Martial Arts die plus half your monk level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The damage of this breath attack scales along with your Martial Arts die on the Monk Table. At 3rd level you deal 2d6 + your half your monk level. At 5th level of monk you deal 3d8 + half your monk level. At 11th level in monk you deal 4d10 + half your monk level. Finally, at 17th level in monk you deal 5d12 + half your monk level.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki points to use this feature again.</p>",
