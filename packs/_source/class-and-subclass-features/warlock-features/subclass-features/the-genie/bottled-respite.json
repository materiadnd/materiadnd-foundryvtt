      "value": "<p>As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. Alternatively, you willing creature of your choice can do the same. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you or the willing creature can hear the area around your vessel as if in its space. You or the willing creature can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You or the willing creature exit the vessel early if you or the willing creature use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you or the willing creature exit the vessel, you or the willing creature appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you or the willing creature enter the vessel, no creature can enter again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
