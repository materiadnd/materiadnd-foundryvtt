If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to act in a manner directly counter to your instructions, on a failed saving throw, it corrects its actions to follow your instructions. A creature that cannot understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p><p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p><p>You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the Duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the Spells mentioned above.</p>",
