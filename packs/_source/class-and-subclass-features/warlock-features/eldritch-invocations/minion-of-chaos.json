      "value": "<p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em><br />As an Action, you utter words of chaos that bring a otherworldly spirit into the plane of existence you are currently on for up to 1 hour. That spirits takes the form of a creature that normally can be summoned with a spell of a level you can cast from any spell list, and a casting time of one minute or less. The creature's stat block treats it as if it was summoned using a spell slot equal to your proficiency bonus. You cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>If at any point you are to lose concentration on controlling the summoned spirit by this invocation, the spirit does not return to its home plain but lingers for up to 1 minute (this time is still part of the hour the spirit exists on your current plain). During this time you can use your Action, or Bonus Action with your Pact Weapon, on your turns to inflict 1d4 points of piercing or slashing damage to yourself with a dagger or other piercing or slashing weapon. Using this blood you form a circle and attempt to regain control of the summoned spirit. Make a spell casting check with the DC equal to 10 + base level of the spell.</p>",
