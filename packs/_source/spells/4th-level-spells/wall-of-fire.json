You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 5d8]] fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals [[/r 5d8]] fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r 1d8]] for each slot level above 4th.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is increased to up to 10 minutes.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p>",
