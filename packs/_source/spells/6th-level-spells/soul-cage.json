      "value": "<p>This spell snatches the soul of a creature (that does not have Legendary Resistances or Legendary Actions) as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead creature it came from cannot be revived short of a Wish spell, which also frees the trapped soul.</p><p><strong>Eyes of the Dead.</strong> You can use an action to name a place the creature saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you are currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.</p><p><strong>Steal Life.</strong> You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain hit points equal to 2 of it's hit dice. Roll the dice. Add them up and that is the amount you regain.</p><p><strong>Query Soul.</strong> You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Borrow Experience.</strong> You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you do not use this benefit before within the next minute, it is lost.</p><p>A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented creature whose soul you caged.</p>",
