      "value": "<p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p><p>When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p><p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw due to the thick smoke and ash in the area. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn choking and gasping for breath. Creatures that do not need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p><p>The cloud moves up to 10 feet in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p>",
