You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).</p><p>While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane (or in Materia the Ethereal Herebetween), you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane (or in Materia the Ethereal Herebetween) by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.</p><p>After 60 days (66 days in Materia), there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane (or in Materia the Ethereal Herebetween), it is lost.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, chest can contain an addition 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot for each spell slot above 4th. When you cast this spell again to prevent the effect from ending, you must use the same spell level to maintain the chests size.</p>",
