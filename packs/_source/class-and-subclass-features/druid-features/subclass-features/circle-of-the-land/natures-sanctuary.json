      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 14th level, your connection to nature hinder their aggression toward you. When a creature within plants or difficult terrain you created with a druid spell, targets you with an attack or a harmful spell it must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the attack automatically misses or they cannot target you with the spell.</p><p>Additionally, if the creature is a beast or plant and fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until a remove curse spell is cast on it, or one hour has passed. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>",
