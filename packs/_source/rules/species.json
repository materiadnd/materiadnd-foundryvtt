You will also find some new species that as of yet are to be published by Dungeons and Dragons, LLC.</p><p>With the release of Monsters of the Multiverse and the changes brought to more than 30 of the player species most of these will be applied to Materia however somethings will change.</p><h2>Universal Rules</h2><p><strong>Ability Tied Features.</strong> Any feature that used to be tied to Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma now allows you to choose which score to use when you select the species.<br /><br /><strong>Alignments.</strong> They still exist but are completely up to the player.<br /><br /><strong>Custom Lineage.</strong> Is not available in Materia.<br /><br /><strong>Long Rest Feature.</strong> There are no longer any species features recovered through Short Rests.<br /><br /><strong>Movement Speed.</strong> All species have a base walking speed of 30 feet or more.<br /><br /><strong>Nature Weapons.</strong> Any species that provided nature weapons, such as claws, bites, etc; now allows you to choose either Strength or Dexterity to be used when you select the species.<br /><br /><strong>Proficiency Swapping.</strong> As per Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</p><h5>Proficiency Replacement</h5><div><table><thead><tr><th>Proficiency</th><th>Replacement Proficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Skill</td><td>Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Armor</td><td>Simple/martial weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td>Simple Weapon</td><td>Simple weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td>Martial Weapon</td><td>Simple/martial weapon or tool or language</td></tr><tr><td>Tool</td><td>Tool or simple weapon or language</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Species Magics.</strong> Any spells gained through the species now can be cast with your own spell slots in addition to the per long rest specifications.<br /><br /><strong>Stat Bonus.</strong> All species have the choice of a +2 to one ability score and +1 to a different ability score, or three +1 to three different ability scores.<br /><br /><strong>Subraces.</strong> Are removed and all are their own free standing species.<br /><br /><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> This feature is removed from all species that previously had it.<br /></p><h2>Creature Type</h2><p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A species tells you what your character's creature type is.</p><p>Here is a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types do not have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplDominatePe]{Dominate Person} spell doesn't work on non-Humanoids.</p><h2>Life Span</h2><p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character does not meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some species, such as dwarves, elves and tortles, can live for centuries. If typical members of a species can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the species's description.</p>"
