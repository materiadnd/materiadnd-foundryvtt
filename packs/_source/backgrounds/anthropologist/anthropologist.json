      "value": "<p>You have always been fascinated by other cultures, from the most ancient and primeval lost lands to the most modern civilizations. By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own destinies and doom. This knowledge came to you not only through books and scrolls, but also through first-hand observation - by visiting far-flung settlements and exploring local histories and customs.</p><dl><dt><p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion</p></dt><dt><p>Languages: Two of your choice</p></dt><dt><p>Equipment: A leather-bound diary, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler's clothes, one trinket of special significance, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p></dt></dl><div><h5>Cultural Chameleon</h5><p>Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs and customs. Choose a race whose culture you've adopted, or roll on the Adopted Culture table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Cultural Chameleon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Aarakocra</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Dwarf</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Elf</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Goblin</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Halfling</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Human</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Lizardfolk</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Orc</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p><strong>Feature</strong>: Adept Linguist</p><p>You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures - enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.</p></div><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life is like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive - or why they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire's downfall.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I prefer the company of those who aren't like me, including people of other races.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I'm a stickler when it comes to observing proper etiquette and local customs.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I would rather observe than meddle.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Discovery.
