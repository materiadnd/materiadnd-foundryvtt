      "value": "<p>Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon, but not a lance or net (or firearm), and that lacks the heavy properties. The longbow or (in Materia) the warbow are also a valid choice. If the weapon has the loading property you ignore it when it is your kensei weapon. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you do not already have it.</p><p>If your Strength score is 15 or higher, you are able to make weapons with the heavy property a kensei weapon, however they lose their heavy property for you while they are a kensei weapon.</p><p>Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon - either melee or ranged - to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p><blockquote><p><strong>When you get this feature and when it is enhanced at later levels, you will need to manually update your weapon proficiencies to reflect your choice. It is also recommended that you edit this feature to note which weapons you chose to be your kensei weapons for tracking purposes.</strong></p></blockquote>",
