When you summon your drake, it grows wings on its back and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed. Your drake companion can take the Help or Hide Action (no action required by you) and it cannot be tracked by nonmagical means, unless it chooses to leave a trail.</p><p>In addition, while your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:<br /><br /><strong>Drake Mount.</strong> The drake grows to Medium size, and it's Hit Die become d8s. Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount only for you if your size is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it cannot use the flying speed of this feature.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Magic Fang.</strong> The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence, and it's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p><strong>Resistance</strong>. You gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence.</p><p><br /></p></div></div>",
