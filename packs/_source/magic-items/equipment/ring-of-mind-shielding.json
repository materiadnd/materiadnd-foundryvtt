Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.</p><p>You can take a Magic action to cause the ring to become imperceptible until you take another Magic action to make it perceptible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p><p>If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.</p>",
