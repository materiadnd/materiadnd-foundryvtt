      "value": "<p>At 2nd level when you choose this presence, you have committed yourself to a life of war. You gain proficiency with heavy armor and when wielding a weapon with the versatile property in one hand you can roll the weapon's damage as if you were wielding it with two hands.</p><p>Additionally, while you are wielding a shield and a 6 or higher is rolled on one of your Merit dice you can choose to make a melee weapon attack with your shield when you take one of the following actions before the end of your next turn: Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Use Object or Spotter's Order as an Action.</p><p>You are proficient with attacks using your shield. These attacks use your strength, and deal bludgeoning damage (or another type at your DM's discretion) equal to one roll of your Merit die + your Strength modifier.  The Merit Die is not expended. If the shield is magical, then the attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>",
