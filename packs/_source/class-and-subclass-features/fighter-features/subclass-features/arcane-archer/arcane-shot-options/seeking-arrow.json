      "value": "<p>Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you do not make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you do not learn its location.</p><p>After you reach 15th level in this class, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the creature or teleport a willing ally you can see within 30 feet of you instead of yourself.</p>",
