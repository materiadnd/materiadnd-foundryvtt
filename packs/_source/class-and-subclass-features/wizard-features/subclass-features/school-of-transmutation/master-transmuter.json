      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and cannot be remade until you finish a long rest.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Major Transformation</strong>. You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panacea</strong>. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restore Life.</strong> A creature you touch with the transmuter's stone is instantly brought back to life as if a raise dead spell was cast on it, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restore Youth</strong>. You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect does not extend the creature's lifespan.</p></li></ul>",
