      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.</p><div><h5>Runes Known</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Fighter Level</th><th>Number of Runes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>All</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.</p><p>The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><p></p><p></p>",
