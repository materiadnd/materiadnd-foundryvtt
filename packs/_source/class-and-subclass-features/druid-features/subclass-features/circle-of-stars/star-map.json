      "value": "<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you have created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.</p><p>While holding this map, you have these benefits:</p><ul><li>You know the guidance cantrip. It counts as druid cantrips for you, but does not count against your number of cantrips known.</li><li>You have the guiding bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it does not count against the number of spells you can have prepared.</li><li>You can cast guiding bolt at 1st level without expending a spell slot. Guiding bolt cast in this way deals bonus damage equal to half you druid level. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li></ul><p>If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.</p>",
