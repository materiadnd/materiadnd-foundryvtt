      "value": "<p>You have learned to impart Dunamis into your arrow, causing the flow of time to shutter. The creature hit by the arrow takes a number of additional d6 equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) extra force damage, and must succeed a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it cannot take reactions, it cannot make more than one weapon attack or unarmed strike on it's turn, and if the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, the spell does not take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it cannot, the spell is wasted.</p><p>After you reach 15th level in this class, the effect lasts up to 1 minute. The creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>",
