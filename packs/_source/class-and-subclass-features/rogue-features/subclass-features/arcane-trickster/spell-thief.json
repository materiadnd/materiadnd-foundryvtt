      "value": "<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p><p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it does not need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours or until you use this feature again, you have the spell prepared and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature cannot cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed or you have used this feature again.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
