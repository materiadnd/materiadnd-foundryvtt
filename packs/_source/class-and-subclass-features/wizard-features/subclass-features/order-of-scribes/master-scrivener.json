      "value": "<p>At 10th level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can create a number of magic scrolls equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll.</p><p>The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as 3rd level, and if it is a damaging spell you can replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your book. A creature can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action, using your wizard spell save DC or spell attack modifier. The scroll is written in a code unique to you and anyone else who attempts to cast the spell must succeed an Arcana check equal to your wizard spell DC, unless you tell them how to decipher your code. The spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.</p><p>You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapters of the Dungeon Master's Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.</p>",
