      "value": "<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.</p><h4><strong>Cantrips</strong></h4><p>You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><h4><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells</strong></h4><p>The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the wizard spell list. Each of these spells must be an <strong>enchantment</strong> or <strong>illusion</strong> spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you do so, <strong>choose a number of wizard spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + one-third your Rogue level rounded down (minimum of one spell).</strong></p><p>When you reach 3rd level in this class, one of your spell preparations can be from <strong>any school</strong> of magic. You gain an additional spell preparation that can be from any school of magic at 8th, 14th, and 20th levels.</p><p>For example, if you are an 8th-level Arcane Trickster, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include three 1st or 2nd level wizard spells from the enchantment or illusion schools and two 1st or 2nd level wizard spells from any school.</p><h4><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h4><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><div><h5>Arcane Trickster Spellcasting★</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Cantrips Known</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>─</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>─</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>─</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",
