Any Beast, Fey or Plant summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits.</p><p><strong>Empowered Strikes.</strong> It can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.</p><p><strong>More Hit Points.</strong> The creature appears with more Hit Points and maximum Hit Points. The amount is equal to your current maximum number of Wild Shapes as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.</p><p><strong>Twinned Nature.</strong> You can summon an additional Beast, Fey, or Plant that is available to you. The additional summon does not have to be the same as the initial summoned creature. If you are required to maintain your Concentration on the initial summoning, then this Concentration can be used to maintain the additional summon simultaneously as well.</p>",
