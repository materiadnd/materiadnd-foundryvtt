      "value": "<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level</em><br />As an action, you create an invisible sensor within one mile in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for one minute or until you choose to dismiss it, and it cannot be attacked or otherwise interacted with.</p><p>When you use this ability, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.</p><p>A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.</p>",
