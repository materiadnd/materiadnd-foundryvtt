      "value": "<p>You have created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a Spellcasting Focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.</p><p>If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.</p><p>While holding this map, you have these benefits:</p><p><strong>Guidance.</strong> You know the Guidance cantrip. It counts as a Druid cantrip for you but does not count against your number of Druid cantrips.</p><p><strong>Guiding Bolt.</strong> You learn the Guiding Bolt spell and always have it prepared. It counts as s Druid spell for you but does not count against the number of Druid spells you can have prepared.</p><p>You can cast Guiding Bolt at level 1 without expending a spell slot.  When cast in this way it deals bonus damage equal to half your Druid level. You can do so a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p></p>",
