      "value": "<p>Starting at 6th level, you become a master at creating false identities and infiltration. Whenever you make an ability check to create a disguise, forgery or to deceive a creature by assuming a false identity or with false credentials, you have advantage on the roll.</p><p>Additionally, you make use of your poisoner's kit regularly to get the upper hand. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can use your poisoner's kit to coat a number of weapons you are proficient with or pieces of ammunition with poison equal to your proficiency bonus. The poison's composition is only known to you, and any other creature that attempts to use one of these weapons or pieces of ammunition is poisoned while the item is on their person.</p><p>When you deal damage with a coated weapon or piece of ammunition, you can subject the creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.</p>",
