      "value": "<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can strike pressure points to intuit crucial information about a foe. When you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can analyze it. Whenever an analyzed creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make an monk weapon attack or unarmed strike against that creature if it is within your reach. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Additionally, when you analyze a creature, you learn all of its damage immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Starting at 11th level, your analysis gives you a further understanding into any creature. Your monk weapon attacks and unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 against the creature or similar creatures (at the DMs discretion) that you have analyzed.</p>",
