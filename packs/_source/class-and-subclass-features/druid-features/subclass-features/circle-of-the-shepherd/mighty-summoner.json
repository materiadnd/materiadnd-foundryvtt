Any beast, fey or plant summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can summon an additional beast, fey, or plant that is available to you. The additional summon does not have to be the same as the initial summoned creature. If you are required to concentrate on the summoning than the concentration is shared to maintain all summoned creatures.</li><li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li><li>The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li></ul>",
