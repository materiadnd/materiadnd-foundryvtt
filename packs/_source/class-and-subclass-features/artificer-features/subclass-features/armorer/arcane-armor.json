      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.</p><p>You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:</p><ul><li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li><li>If the armor allows you to increase the AC provided by your Dexterity, you can instead use your Intelligence.</li><li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li><li>The armor attaches to you and cannot be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet (no action required). The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.</li><li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li></ul><p>The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.</p>",
