      "value": "<p>At 6th level, when you damage a creature with a weapon or unarmed strike for which you have an active crimson rite, you can channel hemocraft magic to sear an arcane brand into that creature (no action required). You always know the direction to the branded creature as long as it's on the same plane as you. Further, each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</p><p>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it (no action required) or until you use this feature to apply a brand to another creature. Your brand can be dispelled with dispel magic, and is treated as a spell with a level equal to half your blood hunter level (maximum 9th level).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you take necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>",
