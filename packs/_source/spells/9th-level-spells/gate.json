      "value": "<p>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the portal's destination is visible through it.</p><p>The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.</p><p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname does not work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens next to the named creature and transports it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.</p><p>When you summon the creature and on each of your turns thereafter while concentrating on this spell, you can issue a verbal command to it if you choose (requiring no action on your part), telling the creature what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, the creature acts as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.</p><p>At the end of each of the creature's turns in which it has followed a verbal command, it makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the creature ends for the rest of the duration.</p>",
