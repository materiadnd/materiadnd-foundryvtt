      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 17th level, your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours, placing your Merciful Mask on it, and expend 5 ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to a number of Martial Arts die equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and stand from prone for free. The target can immediately expend a number of their Hit Die equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) to further increase the hit points recovered.</p><p>If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, exhausted, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned, and (in Materia) weakened.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
