This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the sorcerer spell list.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p></div></div><div><div><p>You prepare the list of sorcerer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the sorcerer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of sorcerer spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sorcerer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level sorcerer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell disguise self, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p></div></div>",
