      "value": "<p>The nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points or get the &amp;Reference[Incapacitated apply=false] condition against your will, a number of Beasts, Fey and Plants are immediately summoned within unoccupied spaces within 20 feet of you. The Beasts, Fey and Plants summoned in this way can have a combined power of a 9th-level spell slot.</p><p>For example, you can summon either a 5th-level version, along with 2 2nd-level versions of Beasts, Fey or Plants.</p><p>If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The summoned Beasts, Fey or Plants lasts for 1 hour, requiring no Concentration, or until you dismiss it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 uses of your Wild Shape to use it again.</p>",
