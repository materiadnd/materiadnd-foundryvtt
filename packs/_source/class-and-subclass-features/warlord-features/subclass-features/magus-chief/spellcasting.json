      "value": "<div><h4><strong>Magical Pursuits</strong></h4><p>At 2nd level when you choose this presence, you gain the ability to cast spells to further your influence based on the Magical Pursuits you focus on. See Spells Rules in the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and then pick one of the pursuits listed below.</p><p><strong>Mystic Pursuits</strong>. You have chosen to weave arcane magic in with your martial prowess, having studied with scholars and mages alike. Your spell list for your Magical Pursuits is the wizard spell list.</p><p><strong>Pursuing Divinity.</strong> You have witnessed the impact of faith take form in self-sacrifice as well as zealous retribution. Your spell list for your Magical Pursuits is the cleric and paladin spell lists.</p><p><strong>Pursuit of Balance</strong>. You understand that conflict is a part of nature which is both nurturing and cruel. Your spell list for your Magical Pursuits is the druid and ranger spell lists.</p></div><div><div><h4><strong>Cantrips</strong></h4><p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 6th level in this class, and again at 14th level in this class.</p><p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> list.</p><h4><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells</strong></h4><p>The Magus Chief Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spell list. Each of these spells must be an <strong>enchantment</strong> or <strong>transmutation</strong> spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you do so, <strong>choose a number of </strong><em><strong>Magical Pursuits</strong></em><strong> spells equal to your Charisma modifier + one-third your Warlord level rounded down (minimum of one spell).</strong></p><p>Pursuit of Charismata. When you reach 3rd level in this class, one of your spell preparations can be from <strong>any school</strong> of magic, and in addition to your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spell list, you may also choose from the bard, sorcerer, or warlock spell list. You gain an additional spell preparation that can be from any school of magic or from those additional spell lists at 8th, 14th, and 20th levels.</p><p>For example, if you are an 8th-level Magus Chief, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include three 1st or 2nd level <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spells from the <strong>enchantment</strong> and <strong>transmutation</strong> schools and two 1st or 2nd level spells from any school chosen from your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spell list or the bard, sorcerer, or warlock spell list.</p><h4><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your <em>Magical Pursuits</em> spells, since you learn your spells through your training to best utilize magical practices in your strategies. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chosen class spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><div><h5>Magus Chief Spellcasting</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Warlord</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>Level</th><th>Known</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>",
