      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.</p><p>In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack or target you with a spell or spell-like effect for the first time on a turn, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it cannot attack or target you you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack or target you you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
