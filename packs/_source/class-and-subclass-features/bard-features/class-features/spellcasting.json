      "value": "<div><div><p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the bard spell list.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of bard spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the bard spell list. When you do so, choose a number of bard spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your bard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><div><h5>Spell Slots</h5></div><p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level bard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell healing word, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of bard spells requires time spent in humming, recounting lore, or dancing: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>College Spells</h5><p>Each college has a list of spells - its college spells - that you gain at the bard levels noted in the college description. These spells are not found on the bard spell list and thus further help express your college of choice. Once you gain a college spell, it is always available to you to be prepared each day.</p><h5>Ritual Casting</h5><p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use a musical instrument (see the Tools section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p></div></div>",
