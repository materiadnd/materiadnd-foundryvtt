See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the warlock spell list.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all your warlock spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of warlock spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warlock spell list. Each of these spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you can prepare a warlock spell of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When you prepare your spells, choose a number of warlock spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + one-third your Blood Hunter level rounded down (minimum of one spell).</p><p>For example, if you are an 8th-level Order of the Profane Soul blood hunter, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell armor of agathys, you cast it using a 2nd-level slot as that is the level of all your spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><div><h5>Profane Soul Spellcasting</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Blood Hunter Level</th><th>Cantrips Known</th><th>Spell Slots</th><th>Slot Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4th</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>",
