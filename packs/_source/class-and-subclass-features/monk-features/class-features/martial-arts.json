      "value": "<p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are simple weapons and martial weapons with the light property, and improvised weapons that bear no resemblance to a weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield:</p><ul><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.ZCvQpX4C9Z8jOiUP]{Bonus Unarmed Strike*}</strong></li><li><strong>Disciplined Attacks</strong>. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. In addition, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength when you attempt to grapple or shove.</li><li><strong>Martial Arts Die.</strong> You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.kenCgQtPgV7G4HGH]{Unarmed Strike*} or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li><li><strong>Martial Heritage</strong>. You can use any weapon as a monk weapon that you have proficiency of as a result of your species as long as it does not have the heavy property. While wielding this weapon you treat it as if it has the light property.</li></ul><p>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in Chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p>",
