      "value": "<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten a creature within your menacing presence. Moreover, if you are raging you can attempt to frighten a creature in place of one of your attacks when you take the Attack action.</p><p>When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action or substitute one of your attacks when you take the Attack action while raging to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. If the frightened creature deals damage to you on their turn they can attempt to make repeat the Wisdom saving throw once on that turn.</p><p>This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>",
