      "value": "<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Fey.<br /><br /><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this species.<br /><br /><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Changeling Instincts.</strong> Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.<br /><br /><strong>Doppelstride.</strong> When you are able to move you harness your unique fey nature to leave a convincing but brief illusory image of yourself behind or cause that image to move in your sted. You can utilize this image in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>When you move, you leave the illusory image behind. Your movement does not provoke attack of opportunity from creature's that see the image as they do not notice your movements until the end of your turn.</p></li><li><p>When you move, you can have the illusory image move up to twice your speed before you in a direction of your choosing that you are capable of moving. Your illusory image's movement provokes attacks of opportunity and has an AC equal to 10 + twice your proficiency bonus.</p></li></ul><p>A creature is immune to this effect if it does not rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p><p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br /><br /><strong>Shapechanger.</strong> As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice to that of another species. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your game statistics change. You cannot duplicate the appearance of an individual you have never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment are not changed by this trait.</p><p>You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</p>",
