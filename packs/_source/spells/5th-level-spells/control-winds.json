      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\"><strong>Gusts.</strong>  </span>A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved, and speaking is made more difficult.  If a creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component or utter a command word (as if to use an object) then they must succeed a Constitution check against your Spell Save DC. On a failure they are unable to speak as they are buffeted by the strong winds.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\"><strong>Downdraft.</strong>  </span>You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.  Creatures that end a fall within the cube take double damage from the fall.  When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can only jump up half the normal height.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\"><strong>Updraft.</strong>  </span>You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to a number of additional feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting modifier higher than normal.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p></div></div>",
