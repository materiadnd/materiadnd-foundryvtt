      "value": "<p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Ancient Secrets. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three need not be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They do not count against your number of cantrips known. If they do not appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p><p>You can also inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Ancient Secrets. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two need not be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and do not count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Ancient Secrets in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can not cast the spells except as rituals, unless you have learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Ancient Secrets. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p><p>If you lose your Book of Ancient Secrets, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>",
