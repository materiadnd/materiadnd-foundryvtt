      "value": "<p>You are a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannons:</p><p><strong>Defensive Field.</strong> You and your allies have &amp;Reference[Half Cover] while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldrtich Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.</p><p><strong>Dual Cannons.</strong> You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same Magic action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You cannot create a third cannon while you have two.</p><p><strong>Massive Cannon.</strong> You can place one oversized cannon (of medium size) rather than two at the same time that functions like its smaller versions, has twice the Hit Points but has a Speed of 0 and must be placed on a surface. You must place either an Arcane Screamer or Force Ballista and you must expend a level 3+ spell slot (this does not use your free cannon placement). This cannon always has the Protector activation. The cannon's damage rolls and Temporary Hit Points granted all increase by 1d8 and the areas it affects and ranges are doubled.</p>",
