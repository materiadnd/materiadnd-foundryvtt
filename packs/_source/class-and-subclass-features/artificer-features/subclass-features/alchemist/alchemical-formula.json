      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, you learn three @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnClsArtific.JournalEntryPage.m4Adm6LEc6BIpmQR]{Alchemical Formula options} of your choice. You learn an additional formula of your choice at 5th, 9th, and 15th levels. You can use this feature a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Starting at 20th level, you know all the Alchemical Formula options.</p><p>You can replace one of your chosen formula when you complete a long rest with your @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.l9H7gLFhbj9XBfEu]{Alchemist's Satchel} on you.</p><p>You are proficient with Adventuring Gear that is treated as an improvised weapon such as Acid (vial) or Alchemist's Fire (flask) (or more at your DM's Discretion).</p><p>Only you can use any of these options, unless stated otherwise, as the formulas react to your specific magical influence to activate the concoctions and you must have your Alchemist's Satchel within reach. If you draw a concoction from your satchel and do not use it as part of the action, the contents disappear if you do not hurl the it by the end of the current turn, and a use of this feature is expended.</p><p>If an Alchemical Formula option requires a saving throw, the <strong>DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</strong></p>",
