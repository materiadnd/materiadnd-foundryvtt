      "value": "<p>Starting at 2nd level, you add the find familiar spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. If you already know the find familiar spell, you may choose another wizard conjuration spell of 1st level instead.</p><p>When you casting the find familiar spell as a ritual you do not have to increase the casting time. Additionally the familiar summoned by the ritual is as if you cast the spell using a spell slot equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</p><p>Your familiar is proficient in all saving throws.</p><p>If you are aware that familiar is about to take damage, you can dismiss your familiar immediately as a reaction, causing it to disappear. You may have it reappear as a bonus action in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you any time you dismiss your familiar.</p><p>You can communicate telepathically with your familiar, perceive through your familiar's senses, and speak through your familiar as long as you are on the same plane of existence.</p>",
