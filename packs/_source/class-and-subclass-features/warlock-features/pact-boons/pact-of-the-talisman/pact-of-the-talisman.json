      "value": "<p>Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. This talisman magically resizes to comfortably fit around the wearer's neck. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, when the wearer of your talisman is take damage from a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage to the creature equal to your proficiency bonus and push it up to 10 feet away from the talisman's wearer.</p><p>If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.</p>",
