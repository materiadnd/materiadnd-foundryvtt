You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon or shield and forge the bond.</p><p>Once you have bonded a weapon or shield to yourself, you cannot be disarmed of that weapon or shield unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon or shield as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p><p>You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands, as long as one is your bonded weapon or shield.</p><div><p>You can have up to two bonded weapons or one bonded weapon and one bonded shield, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon or second shield, you must break the bond with one of the other two weapons or your other shield.</p></div></div></div>",
