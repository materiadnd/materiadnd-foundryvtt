Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</p></div><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I ve read every book in the world s greatest libraries or I like to boast that I have.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I m used to helping out those who aren t as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>There s nothing I like more than a good mystery.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I m willing to listen to every side of an argument before I make my own judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I speak slowly when talking to idiots, which almost everyone is compared to me.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I m convinced that people are always trying to steal my secrets.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Knowledge.
