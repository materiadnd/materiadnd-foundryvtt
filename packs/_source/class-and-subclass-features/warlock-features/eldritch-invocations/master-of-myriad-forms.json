      "value": "<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level</em><br />You assume a different form. As an action, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last until you use your action to dismiss it or choose a different option.</p><p><strong>Aquatic Adaptation.</strong> You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><strong>Change Appearance.</strong> You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also cannot appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you cannot use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. You can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p><p><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. You may use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage roll. Finally, the natural weapon is considered magic for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>",
