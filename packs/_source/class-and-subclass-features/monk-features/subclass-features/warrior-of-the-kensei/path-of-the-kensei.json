      "value": "<p>Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy and painting as well as other artistic skills. You gain the following benefits.</p><p><strong>Kensei Weapons.</strong> Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon (but not a lance, net, or firearm) that lacks the Heavy property. The longbow or the warbow are also a valid choice. If the weapon has the Loading property you ignore it when it is your kensei weapon. You gain proficiency with these new weapons if you do not already have it. You can use the mastery property of these weapons.</p><p>If your Strength score is 15 or higher, you are able to make weapons with the Heavy property your Kensei weapons, however they lose their Heavy property for you while they are a Kensei weapon.</p><p>Weapons of the chosen types are Monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your Kensei weapons. When you reach levels 6, 11, and 17 in this class you can choose an additional weapon to be a Kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p><p><strong>Agile Parry.</strong> If you make an Unarmed Strike on your turn and are holding a melee Kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself. You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Proficiency Bonus until the start of your next turn while the weapon is in your hand and you do not have the &amp;Reference[incapacitated apply=false] condition.</p><p><strong>Kensei's Shot.</strong> When you hit a creature with a ranged Kensei weapon, you can deal bonus extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. You only deal this bonus damage once per turn.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-PzTYYhsifhDnZrr2\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>When you get this feature and when it is enhanced at later levels, you will need to manually update your Kensei weapon proficiencies to reflect your choices.</p><p>The <strong>Kensei's Shot</strong> activity applies the additional damage.</p></section>",
