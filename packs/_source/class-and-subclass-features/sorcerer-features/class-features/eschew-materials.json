      "value": "<p>A sorcerer often does not require material components for their Sorcerer spells. If you cast a Sorcerer spell with a Material (M) component that is 50 gold (gp) in value or less, you do not need to provide that component.</p><p>Casting a Sorcerer spell that has a costly Material (M) component requires more effort, while the Sorcerer must supply the component, the value of said component is reduced by 50gp whether the component is consumed or not. If the costly Material (M) component is consumed then to cast such a Sorcerer spell, you must use your Bonus Action to prepare yourself. When you do so, you may cast a Sorcerer spell or begin casting a Sorcerer spell which would otherwise have a costly component later in the same turn.</p><p>If the Sorcerer spell requires a Bonus Action to cast, you may begin casting it on your following turn.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sorcerer can reduce the gold value required to cast the spell by spending their Sorcerer Hit Die. Roll the spent Hit Die and add them together. You take force damage equal to the total and this damage cannot be reduced in any way and you suffer one level of exhaustion. The amount of GP reduction to the costly Material (M) component required is increased by 10 x the damage taken in this way.</p><p>For example, a 5th level Sorcerer wants to cast the Stoneskin spell which has the material cost of diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes. Before spending Hit Die the cost of diamond dust require is reduced by 50gp. Then the sorcerer 2 Hit Die, which adds up to 6. The cost of the diamond dust is further reduced by 10 x 6gp = 60gp. The initial 50gp reduced plus the 60gp reduced brings the cost to less than zero; thus the sorcerer is able to cast the Stoneskin spell without providing any diamond dust, however gaining 1 level of exhaustion.</p>",
