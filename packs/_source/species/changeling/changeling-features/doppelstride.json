      "value": "<p>When you are able to move you harness your unique fey nature to leave a convincing but brief illusory image of yourself behind or cause that image to move in your stead. You can utilize this image in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>When you move, you leave the illusory image behind. Your movement does not provoke attack of opportunity from creature's that see the image as they do not notice your movements until the end of your turn.</p></li><li><p>When you move, you can have the illusory image move up to twice your speed before you in a direction of your choosing that you are capable of moving. Your illusory image's movement provokes attacks of opportunity and has an AC equal to 10 + twice your proficiency bonus.</p></li></ul><p>A creature is immune to this effect if it does not rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p><p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
