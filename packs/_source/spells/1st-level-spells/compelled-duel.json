      "value": "<p>You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Charisma saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell does not restrict the target's movement for that turn.</p><p>Damage you take from the target of your duel does not cause you to make concentration checks to main concentration on this spell.</p><p>The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets hostile creatures without including the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.</p><p>If a creature friendly to you damages the target or imposes a saving throw against it, the target can make a Charisma saving throw to end the spell.</p>",
