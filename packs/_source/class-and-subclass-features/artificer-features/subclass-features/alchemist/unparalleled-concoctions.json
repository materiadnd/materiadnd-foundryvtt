      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 15th level, when a creature you can see or hear within 30 feet of you consumes or makes a saving throw against one of your Alchemical Formulas or consumes one of your Potent Potions you can use your reaction to cause an additional effect. See the list of possible effects below.</p><p>Once you have taken this reaction, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a use of your Flash of Genius to take it again.</p><p><strong>Bombs and Grenades</strong>. When a creature succeeds it's saving throw against one of your Alchemical Formulas, it must reroll the saving throw at disadvantage and take the new result.<br /><br /><strong>Catalytic Cocktail.</strong> When a creature consumes one of your Alchemical Formulas or Potent Potions their attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20; or further increase your critical range by 1 for 1 minute. Furthermore, they can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit.<br /><br /><strong>Chemical Rage.</strong> When a creature consumes one of your Alchemical Forumals or Potent Potions they gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, poison and slashing damage and gains an additional action on each of its turns for 1 minute. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.</p><p>While under this effect the creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.<br /><br /><strong>Stimpack</strong>.  When a creature consumes one of your Alchemical Formulas or Potent Potions their movement speed is increased by a number of feet equal to your 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and they gain a bonus to all saving throws equal your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) for 1 minute.</p><p></p>",
