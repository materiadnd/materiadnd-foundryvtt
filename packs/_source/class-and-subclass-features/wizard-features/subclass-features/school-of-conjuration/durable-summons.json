      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has twice your wizard level temporary hit points.</p><p>Furthermore, as an action you can cause your familiar to become Large in size. If there is not enough space for the familiar to become large than the action fails. While your familiar is Large it gains a bonus to it's AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0). It's movement speed is increased by 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0). If you choose the Large familiar is magically equipped with a bridle, reins, and saddle, as it can serve as a mount (please see page 198 in the Player's Hand Book for mounted rules).</p><p>Your familiar remains large until it drops to 0 hit points, you dismiss it, or until you end the effect using an action.</p>",
