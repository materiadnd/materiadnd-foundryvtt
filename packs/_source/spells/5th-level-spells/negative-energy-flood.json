      "value": "<p>You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 plus your spellcasting modifier necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as an undead version of itself at the start of your next turn. The undead creature pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. The statistics change in the following way.</p><ul><li>The creature cannot use any Legendary Actions, Legendary Resistances or Lair Actions if it has any</li><li>The creature's hit points are equal to an amount as if each Hit Die rolled a 1. For example a Brown Bear from the Monster Manual has 4d10 + 12 hit points. When risen as an undead it's hit point total would be 4 + 12 = 16 hit points.</li><li>The creature gains the Undead Fortitude feature. Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the creature drops to 1 hit point instead.</li></ul><p>If you target an undead with this spell, the target does not make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.</p>",
