      "value": "<blockquote><p>Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain invocation</p></blockquote><p>You can perform a ritual that takes 10 minutes, and can be done during a Short Rest. As long as your familiar is within 30 feet of you the entire time, at the end of the ritual its form becomes suitable as a mount. Your familiar's size becomes Large, provided there is enough space. The enlarged form grants your familiar a bonus to your AC equal to your Proficiency Bonus, doubles its Hit Points, and sets its Speed to 60 feet if it was less.</p><p>While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.</p><p>This transformation lasts for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), ending early if you use a Magic action to do so, your familiar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, or if you die.</p><p>While in this form your familiar serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, still benefiting from your Pact of the Chain features and invocations, however it is unable to use it's Invisibility feature or Shapechanger feature. Other creatures of your choice are able to ride your familiar.</p><p>You cannot have more than one mount bonded in this way or by the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplFindSteed0]{Find Steed} spell at the same time.</p><p>Once you do so, you cannot cast it in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>",
