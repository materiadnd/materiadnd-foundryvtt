      "value": "<blockquote><p>Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock</p></blockquote><p>As a Magic action, you utter words of chaos that bring a otherworldly spirit into the plane of existence you are currently on for up to 1 hour. That spirit takes the form of a creature that normally can be summoned with a spell of a level you can cast from any spell list, and a casting time of one minute or less. The creature's stat block treats it as if it was summoned using a spell slot equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You cannot do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p><p>If at any point you are to lose Concentration on controlling the summoned spirit by this invocation, the spirit does not return to its home plain but lingers for up to 1 minute (this time is still part of the hour the spirit exists on your current plain). During this time you can use a Magic action (or if  you have a pact weapon, a Bonus Action) on your turn to inflict 1d4 points of Piercing or Slashing damage to yourself with a dagger or other weapon. Using this blood you form a circle and attempt to regain control of the summoned spirit. Make a spell casting check with the DC equal to 10 plus base level of the spell.</p>",
