      "value": "<p>The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see \"Known Forms\" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level (currently @classes.druid.levels) or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> When you select the form choose Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large. You are this Size while you are in this form and you revert to your normal size when you leave this form. If you select Tiny, the damage dealt while in this form is halved.</p><p><strong>Number of Uses.</strong> You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p>You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape Uses column of the Druid Features table.</p><p><strong>Current Number of Uses:</strong> @scale.druid.wild-shape-uses</p><p><strong>Known Forms.</strong> You start knowing one form, @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.actors.Actor.aQzqSysJjyU6eqOe]{Animal of the Land}.

You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the form. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the form's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.</p><p><strong>Warden Mastery.</strong> Any weapon mastery properties you have chosen through your Primal Order: Warden feature can be applied to your Bestial Strike attacks.</p><p><strong>No Spellcasting.</strong> You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.</p><p><strong>Objects.</strong> Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-UZSNhZuZpGAC9yli\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>You can activate this feature to track uses of your Wild Shape.</p><p>It will automatically restore a use on a Short Rest and all uses on a Long Rest.</p></section>",
