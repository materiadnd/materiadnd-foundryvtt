      "value": "<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a form you have learned for this feature. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You start knowing one form, Animal of the Land, which is detailed in the \"Wild Shapes\" section later in this class's description. You will learn other forms as you progress in this class.</p><p>You can stay in a Wild Shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) for a minimum of 1 hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While in a form, it's game statistics replace yours, and your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs, rather than your own. You retain your personality, memories, ability to speak, your saving throw proficiencies, your skill proficiencies, any features from your class, species or other sources and can use them (however limited by the chosen form at your DMs discretion).</p><p>You cannot cast spells, and the ability to take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your Wild Shape form. Transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you have already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you have already cast.</p><p>When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>",
