You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.<br /><br /><strong>Draconic Ancestry.</strong> You have a dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.</p><div><h5>Draconic Ancestry</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Dragon</th><th>Damage Type</th><th>Breath Weapon Shape</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black</td><td>Acid</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>Lightning</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line</td></tr><tr><td>Brass, Gold</td><td>Fire</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>Lightning</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Copper</td><td>Acid</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Gray</td><td>Psychic</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Green</td><td>Poison</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line</td></tr><tr><td>Indigo</td><td>Radiant</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel</td><td>Poison</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Orange</td><td>Thunder</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>Fire</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>Cold</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>Violet</td><td>Force</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>Cold</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line</td></tr><tr><td>Yellow</td><td>Necrotic</td><td>15 ft. cone</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br /><strong>Breath Weapon (Recharge 6).</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy. Your Draconic Ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer damage, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your choice of Constitution or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this species) + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 4d10 at 17th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns after using a breath weapon, on a roll of 6, you may use your breath weapon again. Alternatively, you can use your breath weapon again after you complete a short or long rest.<br /><br /><strong>Draconic Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.<br /><br /><strong>Retractable Claws.</strong> Your claws are natural weapons, which can be used to make unarmed strikes. Extending or retracting If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (You choose this when you select this species), instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike.<br /><br /><strong>Draconic Manifestation.</strong> When you reach 5th level, choose one of the manifestation options below:</p><p><strong>1. Ancestral Flight.</strong> You can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest</p><p><strong>2. Forceful Presence.</strong> You can use your understanding of creative diplomacy or intimidation to guide a conversation in your favor. When you make a Charisma check, you can do so with advantage. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>3. Mighty Exhalations.</strong> you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC is equal to your Breath Weapon. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enervating Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repulsion Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.</p></li></ul><p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest</p><p><strong>4. Vengeful Assault.</strong> When you take damage from a creature in range of your a weapon you are wielding or your unarmed strike, you can use your reaction to make an attack with the weapon against that creature. Alternatively, you can use your breath weapon in place of the attack as long as the creature is within the area of effect. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>5. Warding Scales.</strong> As an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
