If the attack hits, you add twice your Proficiency Bonus to the damage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.oSbAlkPP0Dw6UXRB]{Deadly Aim 2}</strong>\n<p>Before you make a ranged attack with a weapon that you are proficient in and holding with two hands, you can choose to forgo any amount up to your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add twice the amount of the penalty to the damage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.Nrj6Ol2tt37nFaCB]{Enfilade}</strong>\n<p>When a creature you can see hits or misses you with a ranged attack, you can take a Reaction to make a ranged attack or thrown weapon attack against that creature immediately after its attack with a weapon you are holding, provided that creature is within the weapon's range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.XZSD583G2LlntION]{Fast Firing}</strong>\n<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a Bonus Action to attack with a one handed ranged weapon or thrown weapon that you are holding or may draw as part of the same action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.166PFnY8CSx7stuF]{Fast Loader}</strong>\n<p>You ignore the Loading property of ranged weapons with which you are proficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.Gv39SFAn4zrBiYHB]{Fast Thrower}</strong>\n<p>You may draw weapons with the Thrown property as part of the attack with that weapon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.uB8l97pV1Vm7aIkN]{Focused Aim}</strong>\n<p>Ranged weapon attacks and weapon attacks made with a weapon that has the Thrown property are not made at Disadvantage against &amp;Reference[Prone apply=false] targets, nor do they automatically fail due to combat underwater, passing through strong winds like the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplWindWall00]{Wind Wall} spell or similar effect (at the DM's discretion) if the attack is made within the weapon's normal range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.ThZgX6aDJPARtAyN]{Fusillade}</strong>\n<p>When you take the Dodge action and are wielding a ranged weapon or a weapon with the Thrown property, you can take a Reaction to make a weapon attack with that weapon against a creature that you can see that starts its turn or moves on its turn within normal range of that weapon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.0ZfCfjgkfYhpWRoK]{Point Blank Shot}</strong>\n<p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose Disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls and Thrown weapon attack rolls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.LI7DtlGkL2zcEXWM]{Ranged Weapon Versatility 2}</strong>\n<p>Your ranged attacks with ranged and thrown weapons have their Critical Hit threshold expanded by one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.nuIL15ZYdQ0PnTeK]{Ranged Weapon Versatility*}</strong>\n<p>You gain proficiency in three ranged weapons or weapons with the Thrown property.</p><p>Once per turn, when you make an attack with a ranged or thrown weapon you can apply the &amp;Reference[Sap] Weapon Mastery property for that attack in place of the weapon's normal Weapon Mastery property.</p><p></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.8Cgmv9i88RuJ647I]{Sidearm}</strong>\n<p>While holding a ranged or thrown weapon, you may both draw and stow a weapon with the Light property as part of an attack, immediately re-equipping your previously held weapon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.8tSfV6b4VWvEwHBF]{Target Practice}</strong>\n<p>Once per turn when you roll damage for a ranged weapon attack or thrown weapon attack at normal range (as indicated on the weapon), you may roll the weapon's damage dice twice and select the better result. If you are adding additional dice to the damage roll (such as after scoring a Critical Hit or a sneak attack), those dice are rolled normally.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n",
