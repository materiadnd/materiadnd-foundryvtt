      "value": "<p>Upon reaching at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and does not kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. During this special turn when you deal superiority die damage, you can roll one additional Superiority Die, and add it to the result. Also, while you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes you to make a death saving throw at disadvantage rather than automatically failing. Three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
