      "value": "<p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.</p><p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p><p>What were your duties on board boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?</p><p>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and lawlessness. You ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.</p><dl><dt><p>Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception</p></dt><dt><p>Tool Proficiencies: Navigator s tools, vehicles (water)</p></dt><dt><p>Equipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player s Handbook), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p></dt></dl><div><p><strong>Feature</strong>: Bad Reputation</p><p>No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</p></div><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I never pass up a friendly wager.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Respect.
