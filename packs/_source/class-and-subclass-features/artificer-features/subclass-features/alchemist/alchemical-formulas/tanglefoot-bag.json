      "value": "<p>As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a bag filled with writhing, sticky black tar and hurl it at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you. The bag bursts on impact and covers the ground in a 5-foot radius with sticky goo. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn on the ground in that area has its speed halved for that turn, and if the creature is Huge or smaller is unable to take the Dash, Disengage or Dodge action. If a creature was already taking the Dash, Disengage or Dodge action then they immediately stop doing so.</p>",
