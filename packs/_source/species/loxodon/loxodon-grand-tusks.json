      "value": "<p><strong>Age.</strong> Loxodons physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they live about 450 years. They highly value the weight of wisdom and experience and are considered young until they reach the age of 60.<br /><br /><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.<br /><br /><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium. Loxodons stand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds.<br /><br /><strong>Speed.</strong> Your Speed is 30 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Elemata Legacy.</strong> Loxodon have some unique characteristics commonly depended on their ancestral homelands. Choose one of the following legacy options for your loxodon:</p><p><strong>Grand Tusks.</strong> Your tusk are large natural weapons, which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes with reach 5ft greater than normal. If you hit with them, you can deal Piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (You choose this when you select this species), instead of the Bludgeoning damage normal for an Unarmed Strike.</p><p><strong>Scensory.</strong> Like your senstive trunk, your large ears also provide you with keen benefits. You have Advantage on Perception, Survival, and Investigation checks that involve hearing.</p><p>Additionally, when you focus your hearing you can pick up on other's heartbeats. You have advantage on Insight checks.</p><p><strong>Wooly.</strong> You thick skin is covered in even thicker hair. You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.<br /><br /><strong>Keen Smell.</strong> Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have Advantage on Perception, Survival, and Investigation checks that involve smell.<br /><br /><strong>Loxodon Serenity.</strong> You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, frightened or possessed condition on yourself.<br /><br /><strong>Natural Armor.</strong> You have thick, leathery skin. When you are not wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.<br /><br /><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.<br /><br /><strong>Trunk.</strong> You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an Unarmed Strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.</p><p>Your trunk cannot wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.</p>",
