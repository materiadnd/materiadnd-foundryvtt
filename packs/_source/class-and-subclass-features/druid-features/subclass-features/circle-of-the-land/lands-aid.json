      "value": "<p>The magic of your Druid spells infuses with the surrounding environment. When you cast a level 1+ Druid spell that affects an area the following effects apply for the duration of the spell or until the end of your next turn if the spell has no duration:<br /><strong>Ease of Passage.</strong> Creatures of your choice ignore &amp;Reference[Difficult Terrain] in the area.<br /><strong>Hinder the Unwelcome.</strong> Creatures of your choice consider the area as Difficult Terrain.<br /><strong>Living Greenery.</strong> If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer that requires your Concentration and creates plants, such as @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplEntangle00]{Entangle} and @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplGraspingVi]{Grasping Vine}, you can use a Magic Action to move plants created by the spell up to 30 feet along a surface (at your DM's discretion) in a direction of your choice to an area that you can see as long as you concentrate on the spell.</p>",
