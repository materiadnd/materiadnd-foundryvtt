With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain your name and an additional number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><p>When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead and they can immediately expend a number of their Hit Die up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to regain hit points. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When a creature with their name on the page takes damage from a critical hit or makes a death saving throw and rolls a 1 on the d20, it only counts one failures.</p><p>The same creature cannot benefit from it until you finish a long rest.</p><p>As an action, you can magically erase any name other than yours on the page by touching it.</p></div></div>",
