      "value": "<p>Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead, and you can expend a number of Hit Die equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) to regain additional hit points.</p><p>Additionally, creatures that are immune to the frightened condition still must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Hour of Reaping. On a failure, they are not frightened but unsettled. Your monk weapon attacks and unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 against any creature that failed their saving throw against your Hour of Reaping until the end of your next turn.</p>",
