      "value": "<p>Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells becomes unstable. When you roll damage or healing for a spell, that you cause or cause via a Wild Magic Surge and roll the highest number possible or lowest number possible on any of the dice, choose those dice, roll them again and add that roll to the damage. If you roll the highest number possible or lowest number possible once more with these additional dice, repeat this process until you do not roll the highest possible dice or lowest possible dice. You can use the feature only once per turn.</p><p>For example, a Wild Magic Sorcerer of 18th level casts a 3rd-level fireball. They roll 8d6 and get a 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6 for a total of 28 fire damage. Because one of the dice was the lowest possible, a 1, and another dice was the highest possible, a 6, they can roll 2 more d6s. They roll the 2d6 and get a 1 and a 4 for a total of 5 additional fire damage bringing the current total of their fireball to 33 fire damage. However they roll the lowest possible on another die. They now roll the d6 and get a 6 increasing the total to 39 fire damage. Once more they get to roll a d6 for rolling the lowest possible but this time they roll a 3. This brings their fireball damage to a total of 42 fire damage and since they did not roll the lowest or highest result possible that is the total.</p>",
