      "value": "<p>Your martial prowess allows for greater exploits in the heat of battle. When an ally hits a creature that has a Merit Die placed on them by your Strike Like Iron, they can expend that Merit Die (no action required) to apply one of the following Exploits.</p><p>If an Exploit requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus.</p><p><strong>Dicey Shot.</strong> Roll the Merit Die. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, the next saving throw imposed by the creature and the attacker are reduced by the amount rolled.</p><p><strong>Paint the Bullseye.</strong> The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or attacks made against the target have their Critical Hit range expanded by one until the end of the target's next turn or it takes a Critical Hit.</p><p><strong>Provoke Overextension.</strong> The target must succeed an Intelligence saving throw or move half their Speed in a direction of the attacker's choosing. This movement cannot place them in obvious danger like a spike pit or burning fire.</p><p><strong>Rousing Assault.</strong> Roll the Merit Die and add your Charisma modifier. The attacker regains Hit Points equal to the total. They can also spend a Hit Die to further increase the health restored. Any healing that would exceed their maximum Hit Points is applied as Temporary Hit Points.</p><p></p>",
