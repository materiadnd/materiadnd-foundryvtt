      "value": "<p>You release a pulsating, vibrant beam of chaotic energy at one creature in range. The target must succeed a Charisma saving throw, or on a failure be subject to the Chaotic Implications table. Roll [[/r 3d8]], and choose one of the d8s. If you roll doubles then that option is not available to you for this spell casting. If you roll triples then you can pick your desired effects from the table, and the spell slot is not expended for this casting.</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8]]</th><th>Chaotic Implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The targets grasp on reality is shaken; they are blinded and deafened to their surroundings while they navigate utterly lost in a wobbling world only they can perceive until the spell ends. Whenever the target takes damage, it can make a Charisma saving throw to attempt to end this spell.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The target is dazed, and any attempt it makes to teleport or to leave its current plane by any means fails until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You become invisible to the target until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You become petrified, however instead of becoming incapacitate, you possess your target until the spell ends. When the spell ends, you no longer petrified at the end of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The target is weakened until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The creature's size category is reduced by up to two; down to a minimum size of Tiny. The target deals only half damage with weapon attacks and unarmed strikes until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>The creature is magically fixed in place and must make a Strength check against your spell save DC as an action to move. On a success, the creature can move up to 10 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>The target loses any conditional and damage immunities but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn. Then the spell ends.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Whatever the effect from the Chaotic Implications table, it lasts up to 1 minute, unless stated otherwise. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p>",
