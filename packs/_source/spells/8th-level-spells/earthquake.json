      "value": "<p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p><p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</p><p><strong>Fissures</strong>. While you concentrate on this spell, you may open a fissure at the beginning of each of your turns in a location of your choice in the spell's area. Each is [[/r 1d10]] x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in and takes falling damage of [[/r 1d6]] bludgeoning for every 10 feet of depth of the fissure. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens. Alternatively, you may have a fissure grow rather than creating a new fissure, extending the width by 10 feet and the depth by [[/r 1d10]] x 10 feet. A creature in the fissure must make a Dexterity save or fall as normal, but on a successful save is able to hold on to the side of the fissure, remaining at the previous depth.</p><p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures</strong>. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 12d6]] bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not fall prone or become buried.</p>",
