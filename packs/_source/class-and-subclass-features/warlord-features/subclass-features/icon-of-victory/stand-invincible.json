      "value": "<p>At 14th level, those who you command cannot be ignored. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points and is not killed outright, you can spend a Merit die to allow them to drop to 1 hit point instead and they can immediately expend a number of their Hit Dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to regain hit points. If they are prone they can immediately rise to their feet (costing no movement), and (in Materia) without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Alternatively, if that ally takes damage that would outright kill them, you can spend your reaction to instead reduce them to 0 hit points. That ally has disadvantage on death saving throws until stabilized or dead.</p><p>Once a creature benefits from either of these effects, they cannot benefit from it again until they complete a long rest.</p>",
