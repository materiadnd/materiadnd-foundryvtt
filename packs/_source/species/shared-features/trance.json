      "value": "<p>You do not need to sleep, and magic cannot put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.</p><p>Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Upon finishing your trance, you will have to manually track the skill and tool/weapon proficiency you choose.  It is recommended that you edit this feature to include which selections you made to help track them.</strong></p></blockquote>",
