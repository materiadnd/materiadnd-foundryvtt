      "value": "<p>Beginning at 1st level, you can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your quarry for a time: you know the hunter's mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. Moreover, you do not have to concentrate on the hunter's mark once you cast it; it lasts for its full duration, until you end it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated.</p><p>You can use this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once) without expending a spell slot. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, hunter's mark does not count against the number of ranger spells you can prepare.</p><p>Starting at 13th level in ranger, any attacks you make against your hunter's mark target score a critical on a 19 or 20.</p><p>Starting at 17th level in ranger, any time you roll the maximum hunter's mark damage, you can roll one more hunter's mark die and add it to the total.</p>",
