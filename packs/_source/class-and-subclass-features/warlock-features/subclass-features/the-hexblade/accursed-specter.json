      "value": "<p>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as an accursed specter. See its game statistics in the accompanying @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.actors.Actor.dSizUcsw8xqCMvjn]{Accursed Specter} stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. In combat, the specter acts during your turn. It understands you even if you do not share a language, it obeys your verbal commands, and if you are incapacitated, the specter can take any action of its choice.</p><p>The specter also can change the damage it deals to any damage type can deal with your cantrips, spells and Eldritch Invocations as per your Hex Warrior feature.</p><p>The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</p><p>Once you bind a specter with this feature, you cannot use the feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend your Otherwordly Glimpse.</p>",
