      "value": "<p>When you select this specialist at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tool of your choice.</p><p>Additionally, you can craft an Alchemist's Satchel, a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options, described below. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials. If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of a long rest, requiring 4 hours of work and expending 50 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials.</p><p>The Alchemist's Satchel is considered alchemist's supplies, component pouch, healer's kit, herbalism kit, and poisoner's kit all in one. After you complete a long rest with your Alchemist's Satchel it regains your proficiency bonus number of charges for the purpose of functioning as a healer's kit.</p>",
