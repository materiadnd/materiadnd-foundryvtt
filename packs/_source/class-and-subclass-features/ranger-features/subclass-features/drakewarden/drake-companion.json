      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you</p><p>The drake is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p><p>In combat, the drake acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dash, Disengage, Dodge Help, or Hide action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice.</p><p>The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.</p><p>Once you summon the drake, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.</p>",
