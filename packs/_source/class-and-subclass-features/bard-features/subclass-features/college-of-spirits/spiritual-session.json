      "value": "<p>Starting at 6th level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). This ritual does not interrupt a short or long rest. At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.</p><p>The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must be of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of <strong>divination</strong> or <strong>necromancy</strong>. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p><p>Once you perform the ritual, you cannot do so again until you start a short or long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.</p>",
