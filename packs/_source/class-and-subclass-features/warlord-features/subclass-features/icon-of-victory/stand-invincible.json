      "value": "<p>Those who you command cannot be ignored. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points and is not killed outright, you can take a Reaction and spend a Merit die to allow them to drop to 1 Hit Point instead and they can immediately expend a number of their Hit Dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to regain Hit Points. If they are &amp;Reference[prone apply=false] they can immediately rise to their feet (costing no movement), and without provoking Opportunity Attacks.</p><p>Alternatively, if that ally takes damage that would outright kill them, you can take a Reaction to instead reduce them to 0 hit points. That ally has Disadvantage on death saving throws until stabilized or dead.</p><p>Once a creature benefits from either of these effects, they cannot benefit from it again until they complete a Long Rest.</p>",
