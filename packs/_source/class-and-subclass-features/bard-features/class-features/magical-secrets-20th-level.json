A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells, you always have them prepared, and they do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-8Gm7uB3J1k47IGKC\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>When you get this feature you will have to manually add the spell to your character sheet.
