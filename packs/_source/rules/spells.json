        "content": "<p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips - simple spells that can be cast almost by rote - are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.</p><h2>Spell Slots</h2><p>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For exaple, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.</p><p>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size - small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile}, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.</p><h2>Casting without Slots</h2><p>There are several ways to cast a spell without a spell slot:</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Rituals.</strong> Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be ast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a sepll as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared unless another feature allows you to cast it otherwise.  Any spell cast as a Ritual is cast at its lowest level.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.</p><p>Any spell that is cast without a spell slot that requires Concentration still requires the caster to maintain Concentration on this spell.</p><h2>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</h2><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile} using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as Magic Missile and @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds}, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in the spell's description.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any outcomes beyond those effects are under the DM's purview. Whatever the effects, they typically d eal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all three, each of which is detailed below.</p><h2>Targets</h2><p>A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.</p><p><strong>A Clear Path to the Target.</strong> To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind &amp;Reference[Total Cover].</p><p><strong>Targeting Yourself.</strong> If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.</p><p><strong>Areas of Effect.</strong> Some spells, such as Thunderwave, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in the rules glossary. The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.</p><p><strong>Awareness of Being Targeted.</strong> Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's description says otherwise.</p><p><strong>Invalid Targets.</strong> If you cast a s pell on someone or something that can't be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.</p><p>If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p><h2>Saving Throws</h2><p>Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h2>Attack Rolls</h2><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whehter the spell hits a target. Here's how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h2>Combining Spell Effects</h2><p>The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect - such as the highest bonus - from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on the same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second Bless ends.</p><h2>Identifying an Ongoing Spell</h2><p>You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.</p>"
