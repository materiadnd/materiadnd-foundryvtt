Alternatively, when you are subjected to an effect that would kill you instantaneously without dealing damage, you can choose to negate that effect.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 5 hit points from your Lay on Hands pool immediately after warding dropping below 0 hit points or being killed. This amount increases by 5 more each time until you complete a short rest.</p><p>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you cannot be aged magically.</p>",
