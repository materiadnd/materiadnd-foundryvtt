      "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to control the lycanthropic curse that courses through your veins. As a bonus action, you transform into a special hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor while in this form, and can revert to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious or die.</p><p>This feature replaces the rules for lycanthropy in the Monster Manual. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3><strong>Hybrid Transformation Features</strong></h3><p>While you are transformed, you gain the following benefits and drawbacks:</p><p><strong>Bloodlust</strong>. If you start your turn with fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly toward the nearest creature and use the Attack action against that creature. If you are concentrating on a spell or are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (such as the barbarian's Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</p><p>If you have your Extra Attack feature, you can choose whether to use it for this frenzied attack. If more than one creature is equally near to you, roll randomly to determine your target. Once your attack is resolved, you regain control of yourself.</p><p>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on the saving throw for your bloodlust while in hybrid form.</p><p><strong>Feral Might.</strong> You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you have a +1 bonus to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level.</p><p><strong>Predatory Strikes.</strong> You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice). This damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.</p><p>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to make an unarmed strike, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p><p><strong>Resilient Hide.</strong> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. Additionally, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC.</p>",
