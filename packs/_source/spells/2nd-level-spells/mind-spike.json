If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell's target even if you can't see it. If the named target isn't within range, the spell dissipates without effect. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking [[/r 3d8]] psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it's @condition[invisible], it gains no benefit from that condition against you.</p></div><div><div><p><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r 1d8]] for each slot level above 2nd.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you know the target's location even if they are on a different plane of existence from you.</p><p>Using a spell slot of 9th level or higher grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p></div><div><p></p></div></div>",
