      "value": "<p>Once you reach 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p><p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. If a creature starts its turn in the in the illusion and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or lose concentration.</p><p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again, unless you expend one of your Mystic Arcanum.</p>",
