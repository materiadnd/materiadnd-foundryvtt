      "value": "<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.<br /><br /><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this species.<br /><br /><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Dual Mind.</strong> You have advantage on all Wisdom saving throws.<br /><br /><strong>Mental Discipline.</strong> You have resistance to psychic damage, and advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end any condition caused by a source of psychic damage.<br /><br /><strong>Mind Link.</strong> You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to 10 times your level. You do not need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p><p>When you are using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can use your action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you and share your Dual Mind trait for 1 hour or until you end this effect as an action. To use this ability, the creature must be able to see you and must be within this trait's range. You can give this ability to only one creature at a time; giving it to a creature takes it away from another creature who has it.<br /><br /><strong>Psychic Glamour.</strong> Choose one of the following skills: Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion. You have advantage on all ability checks you make with that skill.<br /><br /><strong>Severed from Dreams.</strong> Ephemerals sleep, but they do not connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like dream, but not to spells and other magical effects that put you to sleep, like sleep.</p><p>While Ephemerals sleep they project an invisible avatar that is conscious of themselves that cannot interact directly with creatures or objects, however it can sense the plane of existence their body is on. The avatar has a fly (hover) speed equal to your walking speed and can move through creatures and objects. The avatar cannot move more than 300 feet away from your sleeping body. At any point the avatar can return to the sleeping Ephemeral instantaneously to awaken them.</p>",
