      "value": "<p>You have learned to cast Wizard rituals from a ritual book that you possess. If you come across a Wizard spell in written form, such as a magical spell scroll or spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the Ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>If you select this bullet a <strong>second time</strong>, you may select another ritual casting class and may add their ritual spells to your ritual book. The spellcasting ability used for these rituals matches the class for which the rituals belong.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-b1UbZj2E1716sjzv\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Upon each time selecting this feat, you will have to manually add the ritual spell(s) on your character sheet. It is recommended that you edit this feat with the spell(s) you selected for your own reference.</p></section>",
