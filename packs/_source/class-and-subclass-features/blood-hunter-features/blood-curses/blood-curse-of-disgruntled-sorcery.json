      "value": "<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds a saving throw, and takes half damage, you can use your reaction to roll a number of hemocraft dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and deal damage equal to the sum of the roll to the creature. The damage type is the same as one of your active Crimson Rites. You must have an active Crimson Rite to use this curse.<br /><br /><strong>Amplify.</strong> This curse lasts up to 1 minute, and the creature takes one hemocraft die plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) each time they fail a saving throw. The damage type is the same as one of your active Crimson Rites. You must have an active Crimson Rite to amplify this curse. Starting after the end of your next turn, the cursed creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.</p>",
