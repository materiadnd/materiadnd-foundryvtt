If a creature you can see within 60 feet becomes subject to an effect that requires a saving throw against an effect that causes the charmed or frightened condition, you may use your reaction to attempt to bolster that creature against the effect, providing advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>Alternatively, if a creature is already charmed or frightened you can use your reaction to allow them to make a saving throw against the effect at advantage even if the effect would normally not allow them to make a saving throw.</p>",
