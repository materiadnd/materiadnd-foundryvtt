      "value": "<p>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space and after 1 minute you cast a modified @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.JrXkoLgf2UGHCUuw]{Tiny Hut} without expending a spell slot.</p><p>The immobile dome has a 30-foot-radius instead of 10-foot, 30 creatures of medium or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. Large creatures take up the same space as 4 medium creatures, and Huge creatures take up the same space as 8 medium creatures. The dome fails if its area includes a creature larger than Huge or more than 30 medium (or equivalent creatures) are in the space. Any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.</p><p>Your <em>Wild Companion</em> is summoned along with the dome without expending a <em>Wild Shape</em> as part of the casting.</p><p>The magic of the dome is intended for rest, and if combat occurs within its space the dome vanishes.</p><p>The dome vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>",
