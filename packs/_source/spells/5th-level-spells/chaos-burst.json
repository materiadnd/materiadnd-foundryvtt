Each creature in a 20-foot-radious sphere centered on that point must make a Charisma saving throw. A target takes [[/r 6d8]] damage and is subject to the effect determined by the Chaotic Implications table, or half as much on a successful one and avoids the effect from the Chaotic Implications table.</p><p>Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the spells damage type, as shown below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d8]]</th><th>Damage Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Force</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Lightning</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Psychic</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Thunder</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Choose a different one of the d8s.

Whenever the target takes damage, it can make a Charisma saving throw to attempt to end this spell.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The target is dazed, and any attempt it makes to teleport or to leave its current plane by any means fails until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You become invisible to the target until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You become petrified, however instead of becoming incapacitate, you possess one of the targets until the spell ends. When the spell ends, you no longer petrified at the end of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The target is weakened until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The creature's size category is reduced by up to two; down to a minimum size of Tiny. The target deals only half damage with weapon attacks and unarmed strikes until the spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>The creature is magically fixed in place and must make a Strength check against your spell save DC as an action to move. On a success, the creature can move up to 10 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>The target loses any conditional and damage immunities but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn. Then the spell ends.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Whatever the effect from the Chaotic Implications table, it lasts up to 1 minute, unless stated otherwise. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, each target takes [[/r 1d8]] extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.</p>",
