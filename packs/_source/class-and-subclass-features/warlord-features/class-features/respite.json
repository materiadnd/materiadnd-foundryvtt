You and any allies that can see or hear you within 60 feet are able to take a short rest, needing only 10 minutes to do so. At the end of this rest, any creature that benefits from this rest can reduce their exhaustion by one level.</p><p>Additionally, you can restore a number of spent Hit Dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that took part in this rest. Hit Dice gained as a result of your Respite can be spent immediately at the end of this short rest.</p><p>You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
