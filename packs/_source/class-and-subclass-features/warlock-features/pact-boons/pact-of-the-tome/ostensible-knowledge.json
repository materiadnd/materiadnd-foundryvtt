      "value": "<p>At 5th level, when you complete a long rest with your Book of Ancient Secrets you are able to prepare a number of warlock spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level, instead of half. If you are separated from your book for 1-hour or more you lose the additional prepared spells at random.</p><p>Additionally, as long as you have your Book of Ancient Secrets on your person the expanded spells granted to you by your patron are always prepared and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. Initially you can replace a number of these spells equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Later, whenever you gain a warlock level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be of the same school as the spell replaced, and it most come from the wizard spell list.</p>",
