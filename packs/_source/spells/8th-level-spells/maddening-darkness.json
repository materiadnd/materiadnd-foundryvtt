      "value": "<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision cannot see through this darkness. Nonmagical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, cannot illuminate the area.</p><p>Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 13d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that takes psychic damage from this spell is unable to concentrate and if they were concentrating their concentration is broken.</p><p>If a creature attempts to cast a spell that requires concentrate while in the area of the spell the spell casting fails and the spell slot is consumed.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p>",
