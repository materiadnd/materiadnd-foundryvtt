      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, a number of beasts, fey and plants are immediately summoned within unoccupied spaces within 20 feet of you. The beasts, fey and plants summon in this way can have a combined power of a 9th-level spell slot.</p><p>For example, you can summon either a 5th-level version, along with 2 2nd-level versions of beasts, fey or plants.</p><p>If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The summoned beasts, fey or plants lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 3 uses of your Wild Shape to use it again.</p>",
