      "value": "<div><div><p>You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnSpells0000]{rules on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnClsBard000.JournalEntryPage.uNfn3hEZ0HbtVBCj]{Bard spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplDancingLig]{Dancing Lights}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplViciousMoc]{Vicious Mockery}</em> are recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.</p><p>When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnClsBard000.JournalEntryPage.m2vfXnWW6gdwj81s]{Bard Features} table.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p></div><div><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the bard spell list. <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplCharmPerso]{Charm Person}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplColorSpray]{Color Spray}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplDissonantW]{Dissonant Whispers}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplHealingWor]{Healing Word}</em> are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Bard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in that table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from the Bard spell list.</p><p>If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't coutn against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise coutn as Bard spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Bard spells for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells.</p><p><strong>College Spells.</strong> Each college has a list of spells - its college spells - that you gain at the Bard levels noted in the college description. These spells are not found on the Bard spell list and thus further help express your college of choice. Once you gain a college spell, it is always available to you to be prepared each day.</p><h5></h5></div></div>",
