If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack or unarmed strike against a creature of your choice that you can see.</p><p>If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, when an ally makes an attack with a reaction granted by your Voice of Authority, you may make a single weapon attack with a weapon you are holding or unarmed strike as a part of any action you take until the end of your next turn.</p>",
