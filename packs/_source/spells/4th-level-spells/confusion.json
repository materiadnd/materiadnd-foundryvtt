      "value": "<p>This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature of your choice in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.</p><p>An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d10</th><th>Behavior</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>2-6</td><td>The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>The creature can act and move normally.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target that has acted normally can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.</p>",
