Once you use this benefit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</li></ul><p>If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.</p>",
