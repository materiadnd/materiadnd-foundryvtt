While you are within 10 feet of your familiar, you share this trait with it.</p><p><strong>Bonded Attacks.</strong> When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack by taking its Reaction.</p><p><strong>Shared Languages.</strong> Your familiar shares the same languages as you.</p><p><strong>Telepathy.</strong> You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiars senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.</p><p><strong>Invisibility.</strong> The familiar can magically turn &amp;Reference[Invisible] until it attacks or until its Concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the familiar wears or carries is invisible with it.</p><p><strong>Shapechanger.</strong> The familiar can assume a form that resembles a Tiny animal of your choice of environment. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted for the chosen environment. Any equipmnent it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-KZldHAk6IANXnYWC\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The <strong>Summon</strong> activity on this invocation summons a familiar with the appropriate changes except the <strong>Skilled</strong> feature. You will have to manually update the chosen skills with proficiency on the summoned familiar.</p></section>",
