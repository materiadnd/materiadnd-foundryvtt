      "value": "<p>By 14th level, you have continued to plunder magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells, you always have them prepared, and they do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-8Gm7uB3J1k47IGKC\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>When you get this feature you will have to manually add the spell to your character sheet. It is then recommended that you edit the description of this feature to reflect which spell you took to assist in tracking.</p></section>",
