Furthermore, you can change the environment of your Storm Aura as a bonus action while raging.</p><p>The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p><p><strong>Desert</strong>. When this effect is activated, friendly creatures of your choice that start their turn within your aura can use their bonus actions to Dash and when moving their AC is increased by an amount equal to your Rage Damage, as shown on the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table</p><p><strong>Sea</strong>. When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p><p><strong>Tundra</strong>. When this effect is activated, the temporary hit points granted by this aura is doubled. Furthermore, you can choose once creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be unable to Dash, teleport or leave its current plane by any means.</p>",
