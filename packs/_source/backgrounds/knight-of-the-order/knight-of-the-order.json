      "value": "<p>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerun has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.</p><p>Though the term \"knight\" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerun don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.</p><dl><dt><p>Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order</p></dt><dt><p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument</p></dt><dt><p>Languages: One of your choice</p></dt><dt><p>Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p></dt></dl><div><p><strong>Feature</strong>: Knightly Regard</p><p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community - whether a lone settlement or a great nation - that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.</p><p>This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</p></div><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Use the tables for the soldier background below as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.</p><p>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I'm always polite and respectful.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I'm haunted by memories of war. I can't get the images of violence out of my mind.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I've lost too many friends, and I'm slow to make new ones.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I'm full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I have a crude sense of humor.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Good)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Independence.
