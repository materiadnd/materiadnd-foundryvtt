        "content": "<p>This chapter details the options available to a character seeking to improve their equipment by having it upgraded by a skilled artisan. Also presented are optional expansionary rules for new types of special ammunition, rare and special material, and equipment wear and repair.</p><h3>Upgrading Equipment Basics</h3><p>The process of upgrading a piece of equipment always has a number of basic requirements regardless of its type. The following general rules apply when upgrading equipment using this supplement:</p><ul><li><p>Upgrades take the form of tags. Tags add new properties to equipment.</p></li><li><p>Each tag is unique and can only be applied to a piece of equipment once.</p></li><li><p>Upgrading a piece of equipment with a new tag is nearly exclusively performed by a dedicated NPC craftsperson of the appropriate discipline in a workshop environment.</p></li><li><p>Upgrading a piece of equipment with a new tag is a skilled endeavour, taking anywhere from an hour to more than a week depending on the task.</p></li><li><p>On your adventures, you may come across equipment already possessing tags; either for sale, offered as rewards, or available through other means.</p></li></ul><h3>Upgrading Magic Items</h3><p>Due to their extraordinary artisanship and magical reinforcement, magic items can't be modified using normal artisnal methods. As such, the base upgrades presented in this chapter can't be applied to magic items. A few of these upgrades via tags can be applied but the cost is increased by five times (and at your DMs discretion the cost my be present in rare or magical components used to upgrade the magic armor).</p><p>None of the upgrades presented in this supplement confer \"magic item\" status to a piece of equipment (unless otherwise stated), though certain upgrades may result in a piece of equipment being considered magical under certain circumstances.</p>"

        "content": "<p>This section is intended to compliment and expand on the \"Armor and Shields\" section in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p><p>D&amp;D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p><p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor and shields used in the worlds of D&amp;D.</p><p><strong>Armor Proficiency.</strong> Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Heavy Armor.</strong> Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or \"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Shields.</strong> A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield further increases your Armor Class. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h3>Armor Revisions</h3><p>The Revised Armor table is intended to replace the Armor table found in the Player's Handbook. Previous names are referenced in brackets for the purposes of class equipment selection.</p><h3>Sleeping in Armor</h3><p>As per chapter 2 of Xanathar's Guild to Everything.</p><p>Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.</p><p>When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn't reduce your exhaustion level.</p><p>A character can finish a number of consecutive long rest in medium or heavy armor equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 0) before they begin to suffer exhaustion at the end of the long rest.</p><h3>Armor Properties</h3><p><strong>Disadvantage (Stealth).</strong> If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<br /><br /><strong>Special (Tower Shield).</strong> You cannot make opportunity attacks while holding this shield. Additionally, it cannot be part of your starting equipment.</p><div><h5>Revised Armor</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Armor</th><th>Cost</th><th>Armor Class (AC)</th><th>Strength</th><th>Weight</th><th>Properties</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Light Armor</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Padded</td><td>5 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>--</td><td>8 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Gambeson †</td><td>10 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>--</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Leather</td><td>15 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier (min 1)</td><td>--</td><td>8 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Leather Jerkin</td><td>35 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier (min 1)</td><td>--</td><td>13 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Studded Leather</td><td>45 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier</td><td>--</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td><em>Medium Armor</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hide</td><td>10 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>12 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Mail shirt</td><td>60 gp</td><td>13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>25 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Scale mail</td><td>60 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>45 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Lamellar</td><td>150 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>20 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Hauberk</td><td>250 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>35 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Breastplate</td><td>400 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>20 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Brigandine</td><td>450 gp</td><td>15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>--</td><td>40 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Heavy Armor</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ring Mail</td><td>30 gp</td><td>14</td><td>--</td><td>40 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Chain mail</td><td>75 gp</td><td>16</td><td>Str 13</td><td>55 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Cuirass</td><td>90 gp</td><td>16</td><td>Str 13</td><td>30 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Splint</td><td>200 gp</td><td>17</td><td>Str 15</td><td>60 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Half plate ▲</td><td>450 gp</td><td>17</td><td>Str 15</td><td>45 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Plate</td><td>900 gp</td><td>18</td><td>Str 15</td><td>60 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Shield</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Buckler</td><td>10 gp</td><td>+1</td><td>--</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Don/Doff as Bonus action</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>20 gp</td><td>+2</td><td>Str 13</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Tower Shield</td><td>75 gp</td><td>+3</td><td>Str 15</td><td>15 lb.</td><td>Disadvantage (Stealth), Special</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h3><p>The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.<br />Don.

The Revised Weapons table reflects these changes in bold for easy reference:</p><p><strong>Bandolier (Applies to daggers and darts).</strong> When making a ranged attack with a weapon that has the bandolier property, you can immediately draw another weapon of the same type as part of the attack.</p><p><strong>Concealed (Applies to blowguns, boomerangs, daggers, darts, hand crossbows, and slings).</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks you make to keep this weapon hidden.</p><p><strong>Deft (Applies to handaxes, javelins, light hammers, quarterstaffs, scimitars, shortswords, tridents, war picks, and warhammers).</strong> If your Dexterity is the value listed in the weapon property or higher and you attack using your Strength, the weapon die size is increased by one stage.</p><h5>Deft Weapon Die Size</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Original Die Size</th><th>Deft Die Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>d4</td><td>d6</td></tr><tr><td>d6</td><td>d8</td></tr><tr><td>d8</td><td>d10</td></tr><tr><td>d10</td><td>d12</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Siege (Applies to greatclubs and mauls).</strong> This weapon deals double damage to objects and structures.</p><p><strong>Special (Double-bladed scimitar).</strong> If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.</p><p><strong>Special (Flail).</strong> This weapon can attack as if it has the reach property but the damage is reduced to 1d6.</p><p><strong>Special (Heavy Spear).</strong> This weapon can attack as if it has the reach property but the damage is reduced to 2d4 piercing.</p><p><strong>Special (Lance).</strong> You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you are not mounted.</p><p><strong>Special (Net).</strong> Throwing a net within 5 feet does not impose disadvantage. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>Creatures provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting to free themselves or when attack a net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Special (Shortspear).</strong> This weapon can attack as if it has the reach property but the damage is reduced to 1d4 if held in one hand.</p><p><strong>Special (Spear and trident).</strong> This weapon can attack as if it has the reach property but the damage is reduced to 1d4 if held in one hand, or 1d6 if held with two hands.</p><p><strong>Special (Warbow).</strong>
