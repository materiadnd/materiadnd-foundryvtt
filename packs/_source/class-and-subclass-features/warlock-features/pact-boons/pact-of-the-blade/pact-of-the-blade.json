      "value": "<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it, when you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage roll. If your pact weapon the Deft property and your Dexterity is the value listed or higher, when you attack using Charisma, the weapon die size is increased by one stage.</p><h5>Deft Weapon Die Size</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Original Die Size</th><th>Deft Die Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>d4</td><td>d6</td></tr><tr><td>d6</td><td>d8</td></tr><tr><td>d8</td><td>d10</td></tr><tr><td>d10</td><td>d12</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You cannot affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p><p>This Pact boon is improved at levels 5, 9, and 17 with the following improvements:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Pact Boon Improvement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.2o2EKwfZz71C5pBq]{Thirsting Strike}</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.V4L8NYN6i2tRDnT6]{Eldritch Skirmisher}</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.8KxoDhKbHiYWf7h4]{Patron's Fervor}</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Upon reaching these levels in Warlock, you will have to manually add these Pact Boon Improvements to your character sheet, they will not be added automatically as you level.</strong></p></blockquote>",
