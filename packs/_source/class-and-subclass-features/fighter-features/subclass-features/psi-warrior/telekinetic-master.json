With this feature, you can cast them without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for them is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain Concentration on them, including the turn when you cast them, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, while you maintain Concentration, you can control either spell as a Bonus Action, even if it normally requires a Magic action.</p><p>Your spells behave differently in these ways:</p><ul><li><p>Your Arcane Hand does not have the Clenched Fist option, nor can it deal damage.</p></li><li><p>Creatures that are Grappled by your Arcane Hand's Grasping Hand feature or Restrained by your Telekinesis take an additional Superiority Die and Psionic Energy Die of Force damage if hit by your Bonus Action weapon attack granted by this feature.</p></li></ul><p>Once you cast each spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.</p><section id=\"secret-lUQ7tX2wC5dW3pSK\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>You are automatically granted the Arcane Hand and Telekinesis spells as you level up. Each include a free use and is configured to use Intelligence as your spellcasting modifier. You can manually consume a use of your Psionic Energy Dice and give yourself another use of the spell.</p></section>",
