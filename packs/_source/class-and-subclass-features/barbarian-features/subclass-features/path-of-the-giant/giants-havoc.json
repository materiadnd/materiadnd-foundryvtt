      "value": "<p>Your Rage pulls strength from the primal might of giants, transforming you into a hulking force of destruction. While your Rage is active, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Giant Stature.</strong> Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there is not enough room for you to increase your size, your size does not change.</p><p><strong>Mighty Impel.</strong> Your connection to giant strength allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.</p><p>If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature is not on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.</p>",
