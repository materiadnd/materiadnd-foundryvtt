      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 15th level, your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. While your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:<br /><br /><strong>Empowered Bite.</strong> The drake's Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence (for a total of 2d6 extra damage), and your drake companion benefits from your Quarry feature and hunter's mark spell.<br /><br /><strong>Large Drake.</strong> The drake grows to Large size, and it's Hit Die become d10s. When you ride your drake, it is no longer prohibited from using the flying speed of Bond of Fang and Scale.<br /><br /><strong>Reflexive Resistance.</strong> When either you or the drake takes damage while you are within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage.</p>",
