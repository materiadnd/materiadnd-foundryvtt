      "value": "<p>You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 magical piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, whenever a creature enters a space occupied by the wall, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 10d8 magical slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p>",
