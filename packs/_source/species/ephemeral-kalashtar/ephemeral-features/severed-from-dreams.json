      "value": "<p>Ephemerals sleep, but they do not connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like dream, but not to spells and other magical effects that put you to sleep, like sleep.</p><p>While Ephemerals sleep they project an invisible avatar is conscious of themselves that cannot interact directly with the creatures or objects, however it can sense the plane of existence their body is on. The avatar has a fly (hover) speed equal to your walking speed and can move through creatures and objects. The avatar cannot move more than 300 feet away from your sleeping body. At any point the avatar can return to the sleeping Ephemeral instantaneously to awaken them.</p>",
