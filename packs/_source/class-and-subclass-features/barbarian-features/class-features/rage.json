On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p><p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you are not wearing heavy armor:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li><li>When you make an attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li><li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li></ul><p>If you are able to cast spells, you cannot cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p><p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>",
