      "value": "<p>When you reach 6th level, you unlocked greater potency of spells that create plants. When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute and longer that requires your concentration and creates plants, such as entangle and grasping vine, you can use your action to move plants created by the spell up to 30 feet along the ground in a direction of your choice to an area that you can see as long as you concentrate on the spell.</p><p>Additionally, you can cast druid spells as though you were in the space of a plant you created with a spell, but you must use your own senses.</p>",
