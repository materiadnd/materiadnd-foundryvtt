For the Duration, Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, and undead have disadvantage on Attack rolls against you and you also cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.</p><p>At any time during the spells duration you may use either of the following abilities:</p><p><strong>Break Enchantment</strong>. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is Charmed, Frightened, or possessed by an Aberration, a Celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an Undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p><p><strong>Dismissal</strong>. As your action, make a melee spell Attack against an Aberration, a Celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an Undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell (or Unformed Maze in Materia), and fey are sent to the Feywild (or Feybinds in Materia).</p>",
