      "value": "<p>You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.</p><dl><dt><p>Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth</p></dt><dt><p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves tools</p></dt><dt><p>Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp</p></dt></dl><div><h5>Criminal Specialty</h5><p>There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Criminal Specialty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Blackmailer</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Burglar</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Enforcer</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Fence</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Highway robber</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Hired killer</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Pickpocket</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Smuggler</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p><strong>Feature</strong>: Criminal Contact</p><p>You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals.

But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I am always calm, no matter what the situation.
