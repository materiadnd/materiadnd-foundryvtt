      "value": "<p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.</p><p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><p>At 18th level, you may cast your second level circle spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.</p><p>When you gain a level in this class you can change the land you choose for your circle spells. At 20th level in this class, you can change the land for your circle spells at the end of every long rest.</p>",
