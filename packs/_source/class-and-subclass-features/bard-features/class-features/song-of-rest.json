If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p><p>Alternatively, when a creature expends any number of Hit Die to regain health outside of a short or long rest, you can use your reaction to further increase the regained hit points by 1d6.</p><p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 5th level, to 1d10 at 10th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p><p>Starting at 17th level, you roll two Song of Rest die and choose the higher result for either benefit of this feature.</p>",
