      "value": "<p>When a hostile creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack or imposes a saving throw against an ally, you can take a Reaction to move up to your Speed toward the hostile creature. If this movement brings you within reach or range of your weapon attack or Unarmed Strike, then you can make one weapon attack or Unarmed Strike as part of this reaction. Also as a part of this reaction, until the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</p><p>If your attack hits the creature, it reduces the triggering attack roll or save DC imposed by one roll of your Merit Die (this does not expend the Merit Die).</p><p>At 16th level, you may move up to 60 feet regardless of your Speed when taking this reaction, provided your Speed is not zero.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.</p>",
