      "value": "<p>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.</p><p>At the beginning of the charmed target's turn, you may either command the target to spend its action to make a weapon attack against a creature other than itself, or command it to move up to its speed in a direction of your choice. The target follows your command before doing anything else on its turn. The target may act normally on its turn if you do not command it.</p><p>A target is not compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.</p><p>On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, the target deals bonus damage with weapon attacks against a creature other than itself equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level, the target makes its weapon attack rolls with advantage against a creature other than itself.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, the spell no longer requires your concentration.</p>",
