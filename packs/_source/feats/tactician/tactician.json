      "value": "<p>In combat you are careful and employ enhanced tactics that make you especially deadly.</p><div class=\"auto-generated-feat-entries\"><p><em>Options:</em></p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.laDEIfEWCQyhxWX0]{Astute}</strong>\n<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn you may substitute one of the attacks with the Help action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.gyq4jXYUX6nbwjnI]{Cagey}</strong>\n<p>Opportunity Attacks have Disadvantage against you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.k6plgChY4uHy7hMZ]{Combat Tactician}</strong>\n<p>You learn a maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You gain one Superiority Die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuver. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You may select this bullet more than once, each additional selection provides one additional maneuver known and d6 superiority die.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.yrddEYS5e8N3Ogl2]{Disabling Strike}</strong>\n<p>When you hit a creature that is one size category larger or smaller than you with an Opportunity Attack, the creature's Speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.vlr0HP3ip7Tkh1yB]{In Their Face}</strong>\n<p>When a hostile creature makes a ranged attack roll within reach of a weapon you are holding or your Unarmed Strike, they have Disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.YIo2tpRSioRB7vHA]{Leverage Surroundings}</strong>\n<p>When making a ranged attack, you gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to the bonus AC you would have due to &amp;Reference[Cover] from attacks that would be made by the opponent at its current position. If you would have total cover from this opponent, your bonus is treated as if you have three-quarters cover.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.F3mqK6AEXE3zSa26]{Opportunist}</strong>\n<p>When a creature within range of a melee weapon you are holding or your Unarmed Strike makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use take a Reaction to make a melee weapon attack or Unarmed Strike against the attacking creature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.3jNWb2iklYgbFpWZ]{Reposition}</strong>\n<p>When you take the Dodge action, and a creature misses you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to move up to your Speed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.W36iPV0sqhs1VTL8]{Sentinel}</strong>\n<p>Creatures provoke Opportunity Attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.8nC7kEsDntLlsTu2]{Thwart*}</strong>\n<p>On your turn, when you score a Critical Hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can immediately attempt to hinder other threats around you. A number of creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you or the target equal to your Proficiency Bonus must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus the ability modifier used) or become hindered until the end of their next turn. While hindered a creature cannot take Reactions and can only take an action or a Bonus Action, not both. You may only impose the saving throw from Thwart once per turn on a creature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.74b3e9bSVYqdxBil]{Weight of Attacks}</strong>\n<p>Once per turn, if you take the Attack action on your turn and have Advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to allow a creature of your choice within reach of their melee weapon attack or Unarmed Strike to take a Reaction to make an attack of opportunity against the same target. They must be able to see or hear you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n",
