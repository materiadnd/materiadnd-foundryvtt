As a result, you choose one Fighting Style Feat of your choice. If you already have a Fighting Style Feat, the one you choose for this feat must be different. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace this feat's Fighting Style Feat with another one that you do not have. <strong>You are required to forgo two of your feat bullets to select Combat Initiate.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.X5DLV0ngIRhCRZtj]{Combatant's Prowess}</strong>\n<p>Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike that rolls additional die as part of the damage roll, can roll one additional die of the same time and add it to the total damage. If you roll multiple additional die than you choose which one you roll additionally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.jFbqACReUvFA6gzf]{Crushing Force}</strong>\n<p>Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is one size larger or smaller than you with an attack that deals Bludgeoning damage, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.MKojZivXYGvOwAPR]{Debilitating Attack}</strong>\n<p>When you score a critical hit that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage to a creature, you grievously wound it. Until the start of your next turn, the target has Disadvantage on all attack rolls and if it imposes a saving throw against a creature that creature has Advantage on the saving throw.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.aFyEzQxCXfPSEEpP]{Deep Cuts}</strong>\n<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals Slashing damage, you can reduce the Speed of the target by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.yP77mxUl9j74xawY]{Executioner}</strong>\n<p>When you score a Critical Hit that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die and add your attacking stats modifier an additional time when determining the extra damage the target takes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.SkQTb5daeUBt6kME]{Lethal Dose}</strong>\n<p>You gain proficiency with the Poisoner's Kit. With one hour of work using such a kit and expending 25 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of poison doses equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can apply this poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a Utilize action or in place of one of your attacks as part of the Attack action. Once applied, this poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you deal damage with the poisoned item, whichever is shorter. When a creature takes damage from the poisoned item, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus the ability modifier used) or take a number of d4s equal to your Proficiency Bonus as Poison damage and become &amp;Reference[Poisoned] until the end of your next turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.9UOYJgJ2VshHsINn]{Mortal Reminder}</strong>\n<p>When you score a Critical Hit that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing damage to a creature, attack rolls against that creature are made with Advantage until the start of your next turn</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.BJeznvtcPUf1Xgaq]{Piercing Pain}</strong>\n<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals Piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and you must use the new roll.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.iqgR2nlJk8azzNsG]{Poisoner}</strong>\n<p>When you make a damage roll that deals poison damage, it ignores Resistance to Poison damage. Also you can apply poison to a weapon as a Bonus Action or piece of ammunition as part of drawing or loading it, instead of an action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.feats.Item.5vxSWcfMcQtsfM4V]{Weapon Master}</strong>\n<p>Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery property of one kind of Simple or Martial weapon of your choice, provided you have proficiency with it.
