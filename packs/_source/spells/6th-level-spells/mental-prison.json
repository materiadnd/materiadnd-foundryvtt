      "value": "<p>You attempt to bind a creature you can see within an illusory cell that only it perceives. Alternatively, you can utter a creature's name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell's target even if you cannot see it. If the named target is not within range, the binding dissipates without effect. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 plus your spellcasting modifier psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 plus your spellcasting modifier psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target cannot see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, is dazed until the end of it's next turn, and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 6th. The creature must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, instead of targeting multiple creatures you can target one creature, grants a duration that does not require concentration.</p>",
