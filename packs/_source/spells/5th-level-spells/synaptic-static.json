Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes [[/r 8d6]] psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a [[/r d6]] and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain @status[concentration]. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, a creature rolls a d12 and subtract the number from all attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.</p></div>",
