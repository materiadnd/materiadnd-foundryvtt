The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage, has disadvantage on the next concentration check it makes before the start of its next turn, and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target does not move.</p><p>When you reach 5th level, the spell causes disadvantage on the next 2 concentration checks and the damage increases to 2d6 poison damage. When you reach 11th level, it causes disadvantage on the next 3 concentration checks and the damage increases to 3d6 poison damage. When you reach 17th level, it causes disadvantage on the next 6 concentration checks and the damage increases to 4d6 poison damage.</p><p>The spell causes disadvantage on the next 2 concentration checks when you reach 5th level and deals an additional d6 damage (2d6), the next 3 concentration checks at 11th level and deals an additional d6 damage (3d6), and the next 6 concentration checks at 17th level and deals an additional d4 damage (4d6).</p><p>The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>",
