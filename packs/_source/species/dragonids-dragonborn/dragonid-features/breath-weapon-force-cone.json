      "value": "<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy. Your Draconic Ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your choice of Constitution or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this species) + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 4d10 at 17th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns after using a breath weapon, on a roll of 6, you may use your breath weapon again. Alternatively, you can use your breath weapon again after you complete a short or long rest.</p><blockquote><p><strong>When you get this feature, you can choose to update the saving throw DC from Constitution to Charisma if applicable.</strong></p></blockquote>",
