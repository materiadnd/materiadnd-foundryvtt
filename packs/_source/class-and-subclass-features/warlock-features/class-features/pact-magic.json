      "value": "<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5><p>The Warlock table shows how many pact magic spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended pact magic spell slots when you finish a short rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of warlock spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.oX2Zl9pDIcTlA1O7.JournalEntryPage.8we1wWPCjgF1qxZ1]{warlock spell list}. When you do so, choose a <strong>number of warlock spells equal</strong> to your Charisma modifier + <strong>half</strong> your warlock level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level no higher than the level of your warlock pact magic spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level warlock, you have two 2nd-level pact magic spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell disguise self, you must cast it at 2nd-level if you use a pact magic spell slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>",
