      "value": "<p>Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows - its identity unclear - but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnSpells0000]{rules on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnClsWarlock.JournalEntryPage.8we1wWPCjgF1qxZ1]{Warlock spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplMageHand00]{Mage Hand} and @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplPrestidigi]{Prestidigitation} are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.</p><p>When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.</p><p><strong>Current Max Cantrips Known:</strong> @scale.warlock.cantrips-known</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.rules.JournalEntry.matJrnClsWarlock.JournalEntryPage.LZq7dBzQ9Xm20qdg]{Warlock Features} table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p><p>For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplWitchBolt0]{Witch Bolt}, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplCharmPerso]{Charm Person} and @UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.spells.Item.matSplHex0000000]{Hex} are recommended.</p><p><strong>Current Max Prepared Spells:</strong> @scale.warlock.max-prepared</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1-3.</p><p>If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Warlock spells for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.</p>",
