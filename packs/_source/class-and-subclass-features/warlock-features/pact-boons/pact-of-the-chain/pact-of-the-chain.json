      "value": "<p>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell does not count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, your otherworldly familiar's stat block utilizes all three environment options at the same time. Your familiar also gains proficiency in a number of skills of your choice equal to your proficiency bonus when summoned. Also its appearance can be that of a tiny bipedal creature similar to an imp, psuedodragon, or sprite.</p><p>Your familiar's is more resilient that most. Its Hit Points equal 10 + 5 for each spell level above 1st instead, and it has the Magic Resistance trait which gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. When the familiar is within 10 feet of you, you shares the familiar's Magic Resistance trait.</p><p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.</p><p>Your familiar shares the same languages as you.  You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.</p><p><br />Your familiar gains some unique Actions:</p><p><strong>Invisibility</strong>. The familiar magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the familiar wears or carries is invisible with it.</p><p><strong>Shapechanger</strong>. The familiar can assume a form that resemebles a Tiny animal of your choice of environment. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted for the chosen environment. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><p>This Pact boon is improved at levels 5, 9, and 17 with the following improvements:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Pact Boon Improvement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.fCz8WqWXv49xI1ru]{Enduring Chains}</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.mb95Fi8ujJsD0yvE]{Linked Invocations}</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>@UUID[Compendium.materia-dnd.class-and-subclass-features.Item.FhNghpRuTYIY6kZs]{Chains of Concentration}</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Upon reaching these levels in Warlock, you will have to manually add these Pact Boon Improvements to your character sheet, they will not be added automatically as you level.</strong></p></blockquote>",
