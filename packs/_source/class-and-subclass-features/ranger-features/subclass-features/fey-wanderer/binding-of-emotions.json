Creature's effected by your hunter's mark have disadvantage on saving throws they make to avoid or end the charmed or frightened condition against them.</p><p>When you deal damage to a charmed or frightened target you can roll an additionally Dreadful Strikes and hunter's mark damage die for each.</p><p>In addition, when a creature fails their saving throw against your Beguiling Twist you can choose to have them restrained while they are charmed or frightened in this way. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
