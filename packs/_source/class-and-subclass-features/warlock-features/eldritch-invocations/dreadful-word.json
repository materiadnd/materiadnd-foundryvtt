      "value": "<p><em>Prerequisite: 7th level</em><br />Your words can shatter the minds of other creatures. As an action, you may speak a dreadful word to a target within 60 feet that can hear you. When you do so, they must make a Wisdom save against your spell DC. If they fail, the target is unable to take reactions, and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d10]]</th><th>Behavior</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature does not take an action this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>2-6</td><td>The creature does not move or take actions this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>The creature can act and move normally.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends. This effect also ends after one minute has passed.</p><p><em>This may be invoked in place of one of your Eldritch Blast beams.</em></p>",
